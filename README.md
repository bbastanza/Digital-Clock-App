## Summary

I made this app as the beginning to my Javascript journey. I had worked with python previously and was excited to challenge myself to a new language.

Building this app I learned about sytax, how to use DOM manipulation and how to use setInterval() funcitons.

It was challenging at the time, but I learned a ton in the process.
